## 🛠️ Local Deployment Guide

### Tech Stack:
- React.js (Frontend)

- Node.js (Backend)

- Mistral API (Multiple Instances)

### Setup Instructions:

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Navigate to the backend folder.

3. Obtain ~6 Mistral API keys (free for small models) from [here](https://console.mistral.ai)

4. In each AI subfolder, open index.js and replace this:
```js
const API_KEY = "placeholder";
```

with your actual API key. Do not modify shared_memory.json or system_prompt.txt.


5. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

6. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📌 Final Comment
Vistatia is a preparation companion — not a replacement for your research, critical thinking, or public speaking skills. It won’t carry you through every unmoderated crisis or save you from a curveball Press Conference. But it will help you walk into committee feeling more prepared, confident, and in control.

Use it wisely. Build your skills. Be ready.
