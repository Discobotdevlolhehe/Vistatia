## 🛠️ Local Deployment Guide

### Tech Stack:
- React.js (Frontend)

- Node.js (Backend)

- Mistral API (Multiple Instances)

### Setup Instructions:

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Navigate to the backend folder.

3. Obtain ~6 Mistral API keys (free for small models) from console.mistral.ai

4. In each AI subfolder, open index.js and replace this:
```js
const API_KEY = "placeholder";
```

with your actual API key. Do not modify shared_memory.json or system_prompt.txt.


5. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

6. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Note for Deployment
This project is optimized for local use.
Environment variable support (.env) is not configured by default. If you wish to deploy publicly or securely manage credentials, feel free to implement your own enhancements.

Pull requests and suggestions are welcome — tone critiques are not.

## 📌 Final Thoughts
MUN AI is a preparation companion — not a replacement for your research, critical thinking, or public speaking skills. It won’t carry you through every unmoderated crisis or save you from a curveball Press Conference. But it will help you walk into committee feeling more prepared, confident, and in control.

Use it wisely. Build your skills. Be ready.
